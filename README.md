# Measuring audio amplifiers

## Overview
The objective of this presentation is to illustrate the process of recording and comparing the quality of two audio amplifiers. We will go through the steps required to configure a system on Windows for creating audio recordings. Additionally, we will employ the Impulse Response Measurer along with various signal processing functions, such as SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio), THD (Total Harmonic Distortion), and ViSQOL (Virtual Speech Quality Objective Listener).
